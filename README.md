# Sillah — Family Health Management System (Rebuilt Version)

**Sillah** is a preventive health management system designed to help families track hereditary cardiac risks through a clean, intuitive digital experience.  
This repository contains the **new, rebuilt version** of the project — created entirely from scratch with a clean architecture and a fully structured SQLite database.

## About This Rebuild
The original Sillah project was developed for SE201 and relied on auto‑generated Base44 code, Firebase conversions, and temporary structures.  
This new version is a **ground‑up rewrite** focused on:

- A real, well‑designed **SQLite database**
- Clean, maintainable project structure
- Hand‑written code with full ownership
- A realistic simulation of a medical‑record system
- Clear separation between data, logic, and UI

This rebuild reflects everything learned from the first version and is designed for long‑term development, clarity, and future scalability.

## Core Features
- User accounts and role management  
- Family member profiles  
- Health event tracking  
- Automated hereditary risk alerts  
- Clinic directory and appointment booking  
- Awareness hub with educational content  
- Consent records and audit logging  
- Fully structured SQLite schema
